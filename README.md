# MitoIso_RNAseq_Project-
## Tissue-Specific Isoform Switching and Mitochondrial Targeting in Human Transcriptomes

### Objective

This project explores transcript isoform diversity in mitochondrial biology using bulk RNA-seq data, with a focus on tissue-specific regulation and disease relevance.

- Analyse alternative transcript isoforms from the **MitoCarta gene set** using both short- and long-read RNA sequencing data.
  
- Distinguish between **MTS⁺ (mitochondrial targeting signal positive)** and **MTS⁻ (mitochondrial targeting signal positive)** isoforms to evaluate their localisation potential.
  
- Identify **differential transcript usage (DTU)** across human tissues to reveal tissue-specific regulation of mitochondrial proteins.
  
- Map **transcriptional boundaries in mtDNA** to discover novel start and end sites using long-read RNA-seq data.
  
- Investigate how **isoform switching affects disease susceptibility**, focusing on the inclusion or exclusion of pathogenic variants or disease-associated exons.

- Evaluate how disease-associated variants in peptide sequences affect mitochondrial targeting signals and isoform function.



This study provides new insight into how alternative splicing and isoform usage impact mitochondrial function and tissue-specific disease manifestation.
